# Problem Statement: Impact of Vaccination on Disease Dynamics Using the SIR Model

## **Objective**
The goal is to analyze the impact of vaccination on the spread of an infectious disease within a population using the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model.

## **Key Questions**
1. **How does vaccination alter the dynamics of disease transmission?**
   - Investigate the changes in disease spread due to vaccination rates and coverage.

2. **What are the differences in the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals over time with and without vaccination?**
   - Compare time-series data for the SIR model parameters with and without a vaccination program.

3. **Does vaccination help achieve herd immunity, and if so, how quickly?**
   - Evaluate the time required to reach herd immunity under different vaccination scenarios.

## **Approach**
- Use the SIR model to simulate the spread of disease in a population.
- Introduce vaccination as a parameter to reduce the susceptible population and assess its effect on the infected and recovered groups.
- Perform comparative analysis to highlight differences in disease dynamics with and without vaccination.

## **Expected Outcomes**
- Quantitative insights into how vaccination impacts the progression of an infectious disease.
- Understanding the role of vaccination in achieving herd immunity and reducing the overall burden of the disease.
